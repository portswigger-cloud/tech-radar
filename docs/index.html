      <h3>What is the Tech Radar?</h3>
      <p>The PortSwigger Tech Radar is a catalog of technologies that we assess and categorise based on their adoption level, referred to as <em>ring assignment</em>. These assignments help guide our technology choices.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>ADOPT</strong> — If it's in this ring, we've battle tested it and think it's a no brainer for the right use case. We're not saying use it blindly, but if it fits, crack on!</li>
        <li><strong>TRIAL</strong> — Worth a proper go. We've used it in real-world scenarios, and it looks promising. Try it out, see if it delivers value, and decide if it belongs in your toolkit.</li>
        <li><strong>ASSESS</strong> — Keep an eye on this. It's interesting, but we're not fully convinced yet. If it solves a specific problem for you, go ahead and explore but no need to jump in just yet.</li>
        <li><strong>HOLD</strong> — We've tried it and it didn't work out. Maybe it's fundamentally flawed, maybe it's just not right for us, or maybe the industry's using it in ways that don't make sense. Either way, we're flagging it as something to be cautious about.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Our Approach to Technology</h3>
      <p>We categorise our technology choices into four key areas:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Techniques</strong> — These are the approaches we take to build exceptional software, from experience design that prioritizes user needs to architectural decisions like microservices that enhance scalability and resilience.</li>
        <li><strong>Platforms</strong> — The foundations we build on, whether it’s mobile technologies like Android, virtual environments like the JVM, or broad infrastructure solutions like hybrid clouds. These enable us to create secure, high-performance software that delivers real value.</li>
        <li><strong>Tools</strong> — Everything that supports our development process, from critical components like databases to essential engineering tools like version control systems. This also includes concepts like polyglot persistence, ensuring we use the right tool for the job rather than being constrained by a single technology.</li>
        <li><strong>Languages and Frameworks</strong> — The building blocks of our software, from core programming languages like Java and Python to frameworks like Gradle, Jetpack, and React.js that help us move faster and smarter.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>What is the purpose?</h3>
      <p>The Tech Radar is a tool to inspire and support Engineering teams at PortSwigger to pick the best technologies for new projects; it provides a platform to share knowledge and experience in technologies, to reflect on technology decisions and continuously evolve our technology landscape. Based on the <a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar" class="hover-underline">pioneering work of ThoughtWorks</a>, our Tech Radar sets out the changes in technologies that are interesting in software development — changes that we think our engineering teams should pay attention to and use in their projects.</p>
      <h3>How do we maintain it?</h3>
      <p>The Tech Radar is maintained by our Engineers who facilitate and drive the technology selection discussions at PortSwigger across the Engineering Community.</p>
